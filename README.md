#Psychic Game 

<h2> Instructions </h2>

Try to guess the computer random generated  letter. Do not guess incorrectly 9 times or you will lose the game.

<h2>  Tech use </h2>

In this build we utilize event listener such as onkeypress to read the user input. We then compare it to the random letter. We capitalize on vanilla javascript to target and update scores, guess, wins and loses. We included validation so that reapeated letter do not count as incorrect guesses. 

<h2> Future development</h2>

* Create a graphic representation of hangman.
* User comments. 
* Replace alers with modal or a div on the screen.
