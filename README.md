# Psychic Game

## Introduction

This project was build to practice keypress events. We utilize vanilla javascript for events and dynamic manipulations of html elements.

# Instructions
Try to guess the computer random generated  letter. Do not guess incorrectly 9 times or you will lose the game.

## Tech used

In this build we utilize event listener such as onkeypress to read the user input. We capitalize on vanilla *javascript* to target and update scores, guess, wins and loses. We included validation so that reapeated letter do not count as incorrect guesses. 

<h2> Future development</h2>

* Create a graphic representation of hangman.
* User comments. 
* Replace alers with modal or a div on the screen.
